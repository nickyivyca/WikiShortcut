WikiShortcut
============

Easily view wiki links in your browser, without another bloaty app in the way

I got annoyed at having to clunkily edit the URL in the browser or take the extra step of searching to access
Wikipedia pages. So here you just put in the page title (what would go on the end of the URL) and it'll take you
to it.
